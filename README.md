# Mancala in MIPS

Here you will find my source code for a text-based [mancala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mancala) game, written entirely in the MIPS assembly language. It was written as an assignment for my systems fundamentals course during Spring 2021, in which I achieved a perfect score. Refer to ```CSE 220 Homework Assignment #3.txt``` for the assignment document. Check out ```hw3.asm``` for the source code. Enjoy!
